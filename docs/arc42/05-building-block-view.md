## 5.2 Level 2: Packages

### @dabb/shared-types

```

```

### @dabb/game-logic

```

```

### @dabb/game-ai

```
src/
├── AIPlayer.ts             # AI player interface, factory, and AIDifficulty type
├── BinokelAIPlayer.ts      # AI decision logic (easy/medium/hard difficulty)
├── OfflineGameEngine.ts    # Offline single-player engine (human + AI, no server)
└── index.ts                # Public exports
```

Used by the server (AI simulation CLI) and the client (offline mode).

### @dabb/ui-shared

```
src/
├── useGameState.ts             # Event-sourced state management
├── useRoundHistory.ts          # Round history computation for scoreboard
├── useGameLog.ts               # Game log entries hook
├── useActionRequired.ts        # Your-turn detection hook
├── useCelebration.ts           # Win celebration effects hook
└── useTrickAnimationState.ts   # Trick animation phase state machine
```

Session credential persistence lives in the client app: `apps/client/src/hooks/useStorage.ts`.

### @dabb/server (simulation CLI only)

```
src/
├── ai/
│   └── index.ts                  # Re-exports from @dabb/game-ai
└── simulation/
    ├── SimulationEngine.ts       # In-memory AI game engine
    └── runner.ts                 # CLI entry point (`pnpm simulate`)
```

The server package exists solely to provide the AI simulation CLI. It has no database, HTTP server, or Socket.IO dependencies.

| Component          | Responsibility                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SimulationEngine` | Runs a single game: manages events, state, AI instances, and scoring    |
| `runner.ts`        | CLI entry point: arg parsing, concurrency batching, output, and summary |

## 5.3 Level 3: Game Logic

### State Reducer

The game state is managed through an event-sourcing reducer:

```typescript
function gameReducer(state: GameState, event: GameEvent, playerIndex: PlayerIndex): GameState {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'GAME_STARTED':
    // Initialize game state
    case 'CARDS_DEALT':
    // Distribute cards to players
    case 'BID_PLACED':
    // Update current bid
    // ... etc
  }
}
```

### Event Types

| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- |
| GAME_STARTED       | dealing  | Game initialized        |
