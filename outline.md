- There are many different variations of the rules. If you're unsure, ask me, I'm an expert for the game.
- Always use the rule variants that don't use the "7" cards
- The game should be playable on Android and as a web app
- The game should be implemented either entirely in TypeScript or entirely in Kotlin
- The game should support 2, 3 or 4 players. AI player are not supported yet, may be added later.
- The game should not require the user to sign up. Instead it should generate human-readable session codes users can use to join a game.
- State management
  - For each game session a list of all actions performed by either players (e.g. playing a card) or the game master (e.g. distributing cards to players) is kept
  - This list is used to
    - Persist games in the database
    - "Replay" actions performed in the game, to determine its current state (e.g. if a player re-joins a session and has lost the client-side state)
    - If clients have to use pull instead of push communication (should be preffered), the can send the ID of the last action they've seen, and the server will send them a list of all actions performed since
  - Clients must only get a list of events relevant to them, otherwise they could see "secret" information about other players' card, allowing them to cheat
- There are no freely available images for playing cards. You'll have to create some that are legally distinct, but still familiar enough.
- The game should be in German, an English translation may be added later.
